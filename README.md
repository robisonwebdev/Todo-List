# Todo-List - [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/Todo-List/)

## Objective
My objective for the Todo-List program is to create a simple todo list, using mostly JavaScript. The 'todo' object would be created using either factories or constructors/classes. I wanted to work with import/export, so I tired to seperate all functions into their own file and call on them when needed.

## Plan for next Todo List version
Create the web app using React, and adding all listed features below.

## Features I want to add
- Move checked todo into a completed area, instead of deleting them right away.
- Give the option to delete an todo, instead of checking it off.
- Edit button to edit selected todo.
- Storage cloud or local.
- Mobile/Tablet format.
- Create a pop-up todo form that contants more detail:
    - Due Date
    - Priority
    - Description
    - Notes
